spec-assist
===========

A gem with helper methods for use with rspec tests.

## Contributing to spec-assist

Some caveats: 
- This gem is one that satisfies my own RSpec testing needs
- It's entirely possible it would have been better to implement this in a different fashion 
- I've left out tests
- I only revisit this gem infrequently
- I have yet to document the gem

That said, I'm open to pull requests.
