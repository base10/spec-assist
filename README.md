# spec-assist

A gem with helper methods/macros for use with RSpec tests.

## Contributing to spec-assist

Some (big) caveats: 

- This gem is one that satisfies my own RSpec testing needs
- I revisit this Gem infrequently, however, I'm undertaking a new project that will likely result in enhancements and improvements
- It is probable the enhancements and improvements above are going to alter the current API.
- I have yet to document the Gem
- It's entirely possible it would have been better to implement this in a different fashion 
- I've left out tests

All that said, I'm open to pull requests.
